## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This project will contain a server and use it to retrieve data then deploy the site to the heroku server. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
One should have bachkground in dealing with VS code and GitHub, as well as the terminal. We will create a repo, clone it and edit it in our local machine, creating a server-like file inside the repo, then push that to our linked GitHub account which will make a link for our new application.
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We are using JavaScrip language to script this project. We are also applying Nodejs library to help deploy our site. Express and CORS libraries are being used in this project.
## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
